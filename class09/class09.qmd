## PDB stats

We need to import the data!
```{r import}
pdb <- read.csv("PDB.csv")

knitr::kable(pdb)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

The numbers in this csv files are imported as character types. They also have commas in them, so simple coercion isn't possible. Let's write a function to clean these data and sum them.
```{r char2num.sum()}
char2num.sum <- function(input.str) {
  return( sum( as.numeric( gsub(",", "", input.str) ) ) )
}
```

```{r Q1}
sum.xr <- char2num.sum(pdb$X.ray)
sum.em <- char2num.sum(pdb$EM)
sum.total <- char2num.sum(pdb$Total)

sum.xr / sum.total * 100
sum.em /sum.total * 100
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r Q2}
prot.types <- grep("protein", pdb$Molecular.Type, ignore.case=T)

sum.prot <- char2num.sum(pdb[prot.types,]$Total)

sum.prot / sum.total * 100
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Searched "HIV" and limited results to Enzyme Classification Name = "Hydrolases". Found 1978 structures.

## Molstar format

Here is an Molstar-captured image showing the stabilizing structural elements of an HIV protease inhibitor.

![Spacefill model of stabilizing H<sub>2</sub>O and aspartate residues from PDB: 1HSG](1HSG.png)

## bio3d

Now we're going to use the `bio3d` package for structual informatics.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

# let's fuckin get it
p <- read.pdb("1HSG")
p
head(p$atom)
```


> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
max(p$atom$resno)
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

```{r}
aa321(p$atom$resid[1])
```

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

```{r}

```

## Let's do a Normal Mode Analysis
```{r}
# read an input structure
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
# make a trajectory file
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

> Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

MSA. 

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

Grantlab/bio3d-view

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

T

## PCA of adenylate cyclase

```{r}
library(BiocManager)

# adk_seq <- get.seq("1AKE_a")
# adk_seq
```

> Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

214

```{r}
# adk_blasts <- blast.pdb(adk_seq)
# hits <- get.pdb(adk_blasts)

# get the hits from hard-coded structures
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


Now we will download all these structures
```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=T, gzip=T)
```


```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit=T, exefile="msa")
```


## Now we will do the PCA
```{r}
pdbs.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pdbs.xray)
```

These 3 PCs correspond to dimensions in space. Let's use our new PCA axes to make a trajectory between different confirmations!
```{r}
mktrj(pdbs.xray, pc=1, file="pc1.pdb")
```
